    <p id="history"> My name is Yoshi, this all started way back when I was in 4th grade and I decided to build a PC to play COD4. During that time I met the -TL- Clan in which I spent many years forming bonds and friendships through gameplay. Unfortunately due to power struggles in the management of the clan, there was a breakup. Many were never seen again, and some of us kept in touch but slowly we went our own ways and have not talked in a few years. At this point I have gotten my 3 best friends to get off gay ass PS4 and have moved to PC gaming.There is also Brandon and Zack, but pay no attention as they are just a bunch of GayBois.</p>
